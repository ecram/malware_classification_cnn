# Research: Malware Family Classification using Transfer Learning

This repository contains code and resources related to the research article titled "Enhancing Malware Family Classification in the Microsoft Challenge Dataset via Transfer Learning". The research was conducted by authors from the University of Campinas, Brazil, and Texas A&M University, USA.

## Abstract:
In recent years, malware developers have introduced new and advanced protection techniques against conventional signature-based and heuristic-based malware analysis techniques. Obfuscation, polymorphism, metamorphism, and communication encryption allow this malicious software to modify small code segments and camouflage themselves to avoid detection and removal by conventional antivirus. With the progress of deep learning, techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) are useful to detect the global structure of the code and to be able to decipher the patterns in the binary code datasets converted to RGB or grayscale images. This article takes advantage of the spatial structure of imaged malware, using a series of pre-trained Imagenet convolutions (Xception, VGG16, VVG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet169) to generate feature maps that learn how to recognize and group malicious code into malware families. This research added a neural network to the pre-trained networks to classify 10868 malware samples from the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset, achieving results close to 99% through the use of parameter adjustments and increasing the size of the dataset in order to generalize the model and reduce the risk of overfitting for malware that uses evasion techniques against detection and classification.
